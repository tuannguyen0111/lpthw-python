The Falling of the Leaves (W. B. Yeats, 1865 - 1939)
Autumn is over the long leaves that love us
And over the mice in the barley sheaves
Yellow the leaves of the rowan above us
And yellow the wet wild-strawberry leaves.
The hour of the waning of love has beset us
And weary and worn are our sad souls now
Let us part, ere the season of passion forget us
With a kiss and a tear on thy drooping brow.
